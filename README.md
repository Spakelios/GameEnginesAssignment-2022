# Description of the project

A weather machine that has a variety of levers and buttons that allows you to manipulate & change the weather in the environment. There will be regular weather effects such as clouds & sunshine, along with more unique weather effects like rainbow rain & snow that falls upwards.

# Instructions for use


# How it works (How we plan to implement it)

- Procedurally generated weather patterns
- Particle System for visual effects
- Shaders to change colours
- Custom Models for the machine itself
- XR Controls for player control and interaction
- Unity Animator to animate the machine

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
