# Description of the project

A weather machine that has a variety of levers and buttons that allows you to manipulate & change the weather in the environment. There will be regular weather effects such as clouds & sunshine, along with more unique weather effects like rainbow rain & snow that falls upwards.

# Instructions for use

the player will spawn in front of a device with screens and buttons, they will be able to interact with said items by pointing at the buttons which will make the screen activate and show different toggles and sliders, using the buttons on the controllers and the pointing lasers, the player wil be able to interact with the toggles and the sliders to change the effects

# How it works (How we plan to implement it)

- Procedurally generated weather patterns
- Particle System for visual effects
- Shaders to change colours
- Custom Models for the machine itself
- XR Controls for player control and interaction
- Unity Animator to animate the machine

# What I am most proud of in the assignment

the overall use of the particle system made us realize its potential and how it can become a powerfull tool if mixed with code and other tools that unity provides. 

# What I learned

how to better use the particle system and how implementing code to iit increase its value and makes it more interesting both to create with and to witness.

##### Headings

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
